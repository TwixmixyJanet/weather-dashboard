## Description:
This is a JavaScript, API and Bootstrap focused project with the goal to create a weather dashboard app.<br />
<br />
How to use this app:

* Place cursor in the text area to search for a city
* Click "Add City"
* Repeat steps 1 & 2 as needed
* Click the buttons of your favorite saved cities
* View weather data to make your plans accordingly

#### User Story
- AS A traveler
- I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
- SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

### Acceptance Criteria
- GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
- WHEN I search for a city
- THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
- WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
- WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
- THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
- WHEN I click on a city in the search history
- THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

### Lessons Learned

#### 1. APIs
[Today's Weather API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=marietta&appid=b2da1db112f5ef2d52f8606a017dc730)<br />
[Forecast Weather API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?q=Marietta&appid=b2da1db112f5ef2d52f8606a017dc730)<br />
Figuring out the APIs was definitely my biggest hangup. I could not get the URL correct for the forecast because I was using something called onecall, that I thought I was supposed to use. Thankfully one of the AskBCS teachers helped me see why I was receiving the unauthorized error and pointed me in the direction of finding the forecast API URL.

#### 2. Displaying API data points
This of course leads into how to properly display the API data once I had it linked correctly. For this I placed the above URLs in my browser and looked through the properties until I could find the traversal method of displaying the data.

#### 3. Looping through dayjs
After I figured out my API issues and most of the data points needed for displaying, I then encountered the issue of how to increment the date to properly display for the forecast. I tried probably at least a dozen different ways before I landed on deciding to use an object to increment to additional days.

#### 4. Bootstrap
Since the last assignment contained all the boostrap code we needed, this project was a great opportunity for me to do some research and find the classes I wanted to apply for a decent layout for the app. I still used the custom style sheet for a couple properties I couldn't think how to apply, but I was very happy with the row and column properties here. Also the Jumbotron!!

#### Synopsis
Overall this was another great learning experience for me. It tested my knowledge from the last three weeks and also tested my patience in coming up with the solutions I needed. One of the biggest lessons I learned here was to reach out for help after struggling with an issue for anywhere over an hour. To make sure I have console logged everything I can think of and fix all the things I can fix, then reach out for help with the remaining aspects.
